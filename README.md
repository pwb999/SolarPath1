# SolarPath+
This is an enhanced version of the standard Solar Path app.
The initial screen is a graphical display of various azimuths or bearings relating to the Sun's path.
Sunrise, sunset and solar noon are shown together with compass directional lines to illustrate its movement as the Suns azimuth 
moves East throughout its journey. Its reciprocal Shadow is also available.
The graphic display can be customised via the Settings button.
The Default display uses a Location manually input by the user via a picker screen.
The user can select to use live GPS via a toggle option on the Settings button. The updated location is then used instead.
The Location tab shows a green highlighted updated date and time to show "GPS in use".

Currently in TestFlight and hopefully available on the Apple App Store soon ...
