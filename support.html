        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Q: Why is the azimuth off by a few degrees?</strong><br>A: The estimated accuracy is good for a few degrees and minutes. As the intention was to design a lightweight app that does not use online resources there will be some difference between web sources and this app.
            As its geared towards outdoor users it is certainly accurate for all practical purposes. Variations can occur due to device sensors, GPS accuracy, or local atmospheric conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Q: Can I use the app offline?</strong><br>A: The app relies on the watches GPS signal for accurate results.</li>
            <li><strong>Q: What time zone does the app use?</strong><br>A: All times are shown in your current local time.</li>
