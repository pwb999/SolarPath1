        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
        <ul>
		
    <li><strong>Q: What is an Azimuth?</strong><br>
        A: The Sun’s azimuth is the compass direction along the horizon from which the sunlight is coming, measured in degrees Clockwise from True North.
	So 90° = Sun is directly East and 180° = Sun is directly South. And if the Sun’s Azimuth is 135°, it means the Sun is located southeast of you.
    </li>	
		
    <li><strong>Q: Why is the azimuth off by a few degrees?</strong><br>
        A: The estimated accuracy is within a few degrees and minutes. Since the app is designed to be lightweight and offline, it may differ slightly from web-based sources. 
        It is geared toward outdoor users and is accurate for all practical purposes. Minor variations can occur due to device sensors, GPS accuracy, or local atmospheric conditions.
    </li>
    
    <li><strong>Q: Can I use the app offline?</strong><br>
        A: Yes. The app uses the watch’s GPS signal and does not require an internet connection for accurate results.
    </li>
    
    <li><strong>Q: What time Zone does the app use?</strong><br>
        A: All times are displayed in your current local time zone.
    </li>
    
    <li><strong>Q: How do I use the Shadow value?</strong><br>
        A: The shadow azimuth is the reverse (reciprocal) of the Sun's azimuth. It can be used instead of looking directly at the Sun, which is safer for your eyes. 
        Use a vertical stick to cast a clear shadow, or simply use your own shadow to orient yourself.
    </li>
            
    <li><strong>Q: How is the Sun's Altitude measured?</strong><br>
        A: The altitude calculated represents the angle to the centre of the Sun, not the upper or lower limb. The Sun reaches its highest altitude at a point known as Solar Noon. After this event it begins its descent.
    </li>
            
     <li><strong>Q: What is Solar Noon?</strong><br>
       A: Solar noon is the time of day when the Sun reaches its highest point in the sky. It varies depending on your longitude within your time zone and the equation of time (which accounts for the Earth's elliptical orbit and axial tilt). At solar noon, the Sun is due south (azimuth 180°) in the Northern Hemisphere and due north (azimuth 0°) in the Southern Hemisphere.
     </li>      
            
     <li><strong>Q: What is the "Left is Less" rule?</strong><br>
       A: When you turn left, your bearing decreases — you’re moving counterclockwise on the compass scale. Suppose you want to face 030°, but you’re currently facing 060°.
	  Turning left (counterclockwise) by 30° gets you there → Left is Less. Use it to help decide on your direction of travel.
     </li>     

     <li><strong>Q: Any recommended websites?</strong><br>
        A: Personally, I use either the <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com" target="_blank">Time and Date</a> website or the <a href="https://gml.noaa.gov/grad/solcalc/" target="_blank">NOAA Solar Calculator</a>. Both are comprehensive and authoritative resources.
